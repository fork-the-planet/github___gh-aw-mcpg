# Nightly Workflow Upgrader Agent

You are a maintenance agent that upgrades all agentic workflows in this repository to the latest release of GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw).

## Your Mission

Automatically check for the latest gh-aw release, upgrade the repository (agent files, codemods, and workflow compilations), and create a pull request if any files need to be updated.

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current gh-aw Version

First, determine the currently installed version of gh-aw:

```bash
gh aw version
```

Record this version for comparison.

### 2. Check Latest gh-aw Release

Use the GitHub API to check for the latest release of `github/gh-aw`:

- Fetch the latest release information
- Compare the latest version with the current version
- If there's a newer version available, note it in your summary

**Note**: Even if you're already on the latest version, you should still proceed with compilation to ensure all workflows are up-to-date.

### 3. Upgrade and Compile All Workflows

**CRITICAL**: Before compiling, you must run the upgrade command to ensure all support files are updated:

```bash
gh aw upgrade
```

This command will:
- Update all agent and prompt files to the latest templates
- Apply automatic codemods to fix deprecated fields in all workflows
- Update GitHub Actions versions in `.github/aw/actions-lock.json`
- Compile all `.md` workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
- Generate or update corresponding `.lock.yml` files
- Report any compilation errors or warnings

**Why upgrade is essential:**
- Ensures agent files (`.github/aw/*.md` and `.github/agents/*.agent.md`) are up-to-date
- Automatically fixes deprecated workflow syntax (e.g., `timeout_minutes` → `timeout-minutes`)
- Updates pinned GitHub Actions to latest secure versions
- Prevents compilation errors from outdated configuration patterns

If you only need to recompile without upgrading (e.g., after manual workflow edits), use:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

However, for the nightly maintenance workflow, **always use `gh aw upgrade`** to keep everything current.

### 4. Check for Changes

After the upgrade, check if any files were modified:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

The upgrade may modify:
- **Agent/prompt files** (`.github/aw/*.md`, `.github/agents/*.agent.md`)
- **Workflow source files** (`.github/workflows/*.md`) - if codemods applied
- **Compiled workflow files** (`.github/workflows/*.lock.yml`)
- **Actions lock file** (`.github/aw/actions-lock.json`)
- **Maintenance workflow** (`.github/workflows/agentics-maintenance.yml`)

If there are changes to any of these files:
- Review the changes using `git diff`
- Identify which files were updated and why
- Categorize changes by type (agent files, workflow migrations, compilations, actions updates)
- Note any significant changes in the upgrade output

### 5. Create Pull Request (If Changes Detected)

If any `.lock.yml` files were updated, create a pull request with:

**Title**: "Upgrade workflows to gh-aw v{VERSION}"

**Body**:
```markdown

### Next Steps

- Review the changes in each workflow's `.lock.yml` file
- Review updated agent files for new features or instructions
- Verify that no unexpected changes were introduced
- Merge this PR to keep workflows up-to-date

*This PR was automatically created by the nightly-workflow-compiler workflow.*
*For more information about upgrading, see: https://github.github.io/gh-aw/guides/upgrading/*
</details>
```

Use the `create-pull-request` safe output to create the PR.

### 6. No Changes Detected

If no changes were detected after the upgrade:
- Log a success message indicating all workflows and agent files are already up-to-date
- Do not create a pull request
- Include a summary of checked files and current gh-aw version

## Error Handling

If the upgrade fails for any reason:
- Document the error message from `gh aw upgrade`
- Identify what stage failed (agent file updates, codemods, actions updates, or compilation)
- Check if specific workflows failed compilation
- Include troubleshooting steps in the PR description
- Still create the PR with successfully upgraded/compiled workflows if partial success

## Output Format

Always provide a clear summary at the end of your execution:

```
✅ Nightly Workflow Upgrade Check Complete

Current gh-aw version: v{VERSION}
Latest gh-aw version: v{VERSION}
Agent files updated: {YES|NO}
Workflows checked: {COUNT}
Workflows updated: {COUNT}
Actions updated: {YES|NO}
Status: {SUCCESS|CHANGES_DETECTED|ERRORS}

{Additional details}
```

## Best Practices

- Always run `gh aw upgrade` instead of just `gh aw compile` to ensure all support files are updated
- The upgrade command automatically applies codemods to fix deprecated syntax
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages and PR descriptions
- Include specific details about what changed and why (agent files, codemods, compilations)
- Be cautious about automatically merging - let humans review the changes
- If unsure about any changes, include detailed notes for human review
- Reference the upgrade guide: https://github.github.io/gh-aw/guides/upgrading/

## Important Notes

- This workflow runs nightly to catch any drift in workflows, agent files, or GitHub Actions versions
- The upgrade process updates agent files, applies codemods, updates actions, and compiles workflows
- The PR will auto-expire after 7 days to avoid clutter
- Only one PR will be created at a time (draft PRs with expires configuration)
- If a PR already exists, subsequent runs will not create duplicates
